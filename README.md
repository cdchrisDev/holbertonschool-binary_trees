## Learning Objectives
* What is a binary tree
	* A `binary tree`is a data structure that implement at most 2 nodes for each node in the path (just two no more).
* What is the difference between a Binary tree and a binary search tree
	* A Binary Tree is a basic structure with a simple rule that no parent must have more than 2 children whereas the Binary Search Tree is a variant of the binary tree following a particular order with which the nodes should be organized.
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
	* The main advantage of using binary trees is simplicity. Binary trees possess a simple-to-understand structure for data management and organization. Additionally, some benefits of binary trees are: They can be used to reflect relationships between data
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
	* **Height**:is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.
	* **Size**: is the total number of nodes in the tree.
	* **depth**: is the length of the path from the root to a particular node.
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
	* **Preorder traversal**: In this traversal, the left child node is visited first, then the root node is visited and later we go for visiting the right child node.
	* **Postorder traversal**: Each root is visited after its left and right subtrees have been traversed.
	* **Inorder traversal**: You traverse from the left subtree to the root then to the right subtree.
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.
	* **Complete**: Is a biary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
	* **Full**: Is a binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
	* **Perfect**: Is a binary tree in which all anterior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.
